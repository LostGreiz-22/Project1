                I was convinced that I'd struggle to play Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered with a keyboard and mouse. <br>The thrilling web-swinging and complex slugfests of Insomniac's open-world Spidey game feel so specifically tailored to a PlayStation controller that I couldn't imagine how anyone could feasibly translate it to the PC's traditional control scheme. 
                <br>Yet not only is Spider-Man Remastered perfectly playable on keyboard and mouse, in some ways it's superior to the PS4 experience.<br>


Swinging through the New York skyline was always the best bit of Insomniac's title â€“ with the Ratchet & Clank studio delivering possibly the best movement system in any game of the last decade.<br>
 Traversing Manhattan as Spidey is equally enjoyable on PC, only now you press and hold left-shift to start and maintain a swing, interspersed with deft taps of the spacebar to add little bursts of straight-line speed. 
 <br>But it's the addition of mouse control that really gives the PC version an edge, letting you slip through tiny gaps between tenements and skyscrapers in a much smoother fashion than with a pad. 
 <br>Spidey's web-swinging was designed to make you feel like an experienced superhero in his element, and the mouse makes inhabiting this fantasy that much easier.<br>
